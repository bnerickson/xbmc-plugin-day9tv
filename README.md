xbmc-plugin-day9tv
==================

An XBMC plugin to view the Day[9].tv Daily Archives.


This is based very heavily off of the day9 plugin by
petersson.krill@gmail.com (http://code.google.com/p/xbmc-plugin-day9/)

His code is available via code.google.com.  If it supported github I would
have just forked it and left it as a offshoot of his work, but I couldn't do
that so I've setup a new repo at github.

The plugin has been updated to use the new day9.tv website as it's archive
source, and to use the youtube plugin as the video player.

I have added "search" to the page but I haven't written any code for that part
yet.
